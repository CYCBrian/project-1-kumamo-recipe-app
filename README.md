## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

Have you ever found yourself staring at the chaos in your fridge, unable to think of a way to utilize what's in it? We've all been there, and now we have created a solution to that common problem! üêª Kumamo is an easy to use **application that will choose your meal for you!** 

Using our website, you can **enter ingredients found in your fridge**, and the page will **find you a dish that uses those ingredients**. 

Our website uses API functionality to provide you, the user, with **recipes, photos, links, and even nutritional facts** so that you can find exaclty what you're looking for. You will also be provided with various options to choose from, in case the first dish doesn't match with your personal taste.
