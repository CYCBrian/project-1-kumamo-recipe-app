## Description

Have you ever found yourself staring at chaos in your fridge unable to think of a way to utilize what's in it? We've all been there, and now we have created an application that will choose your meal for you! You can enter ingredients found in your fridge, and the website will find you a dish that uses those ingredients. Our website uses API functionality to provide the user with recipes, photos, links, and even nutrition facts so that you can find exaclty what you're looking for.
